When Fakhar Zaman has these kinds of days, there's very little any side can do about it; and what makes him so special is he has days like these with frightening regularity. A third successive ODI hundred - this one a monster century - by Pakistan's premier ODI opener blitzed New Zealand, as he cracked an unbeaten 180 off 144 balls.
It helped his side coast to their second-highest chase in the format, running down New Zealand's 336 with seven wickets and almost two overs to spare. A 135-run stand with Babar Azam, who scored 65, formed the backbone of the chase, while a devastating counter-attacking partnership with Mohammad Rizwan swept the game out of New Zealand's reach.
